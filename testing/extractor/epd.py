This declaration is an environmental product declaration (EPD) in accordance with ISO 14025. EPDs rely
on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to provide information on a number of environmental impacts of products
over their life cycle. Exclusions: EPDs do not indicate that any environmental or social performance
benchmarks are met, and there may be impacts that they do not encompass. LCAs do not typically
address the site-specific environmental impacts of raw material extraction, nor are they meant to assess human health
toxicity. EPDs can complement but cannot replace tools and certifications that are designed to address these impacts
and/or set performance thresholds – e.g. Type 1 certifications, health assessments and declarations, environmental
impact assessments, etc. Accuracy of Results: EPDs regularly rely on estimations of impacts, and the level of
accuracy in estimation of effect differs for any particular product line and reported impact. Comparability: EPDs are not
comparative assertions and are either not comparable or have limited comparability when they cover different life cycle
stages, are based on different product category rules or are missing relevant environmental impacts. EPDs from
different programs may not be comparable.

This environmental product declaration (EPD) covers Eggers interior flush and stile and rail doors, which include nonrated, rated, acoustical, bullet resistant, lead-lined and impact resistant constructions. These doors are designed for
installation in interior spaces. The results represent a production-weighted average door leaf.

This EPD covers Eggers interior flush and stile and rail doors which include non-rated, rated, acoustical, bullet
resistant, lead-lined and impact resistant constructions. 

This EPD declares the impacts of a production-weighted average wood door leaf from cradle to gate. Therefore, postmanufacturing life cycle stages are not considered in this declaration. The applied system boundary represents the life
cycle modules A1, A2, and A3 as defined by EN 15804 and shown in Figure 2.
